  I’m Shuzheng Si, a first-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Tsinghua University. I am lucky to be advised by Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=zIgT0HMAAAAJ">Maosong Sun</a> and affiliated with <a href="https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn">TsinghuaNLP Lab</a>. Previously, I obtained my master’s degree from Peking University, where I was fortunate to be a part of the <a href="https://pkunlp-icler.github.io/">PKU NLP Group</a> under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=LaKNyhQAAAAJ">Baobao Chang</a> at the Institute of Computational Linguistics. My research interests lie in <b>Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs)</b>, specifically focusing on Data-Centric Methods and Data Science for NLP, including:
  <br>
  <ul class="pub">
      <li>
          <b style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Synthesis & Data Selection</b>: My research in this area aims to explore automated methods for data synthesis (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16483">CANOE</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04153">UltraIF</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05282">UltraEdit</a>), as well as automated validation of data quality (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07340">NOVA</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15633">GATEAU</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10302">Nuggets</a>), in order to improve model performance.
      </li>
      <li>
          <b style="text-decoration: underline;">Data-Efficient Methods for Post-Training</b>: This area of research attempts to explore data-efficient approaches for improving model performance, such as using noisy data from real-world scenarios to train the model () and maximizing the positive impact of the data on the model ().
      </li>
  </ul>

  My long-term research goal is to elucidate the influence of data on LLMs and subsequently utilize these insights to effectively guide the organization, selection, and synthesis of high-quality data, thereby enhancing the foundational capabilities of LLMs (e.g., instruction following, factuality, and faithfulness). I am really interested in collaboration, feel free to drop me an email for any opportunity!
