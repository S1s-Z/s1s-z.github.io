  I’m Shuzheng Si, a first-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Tsinghua University. I am lucky to be advised by Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=zIgT0HMAAAAJ">Maosong Sun</a> and affiliated with <a href="https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn">TsinghuaNLP Lab</a>. Previously, I obtained my master’s degree from Peking University, where I was fortunate to be a part of the <a href="https://pkunlp-icler.github.io/">PKU NLP Group</a> under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=LaKNyhQAAAAJ">Baobao Chang</a> at the Institute of Computational Linguistics. </br></br> Now, my research interests lie in Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models, specifically focusing on Data-centric Methods and Data Science for NLP, including Data Selection, Data Synthesis, and Learning from Noisy Data, etc. My long-term research goal is to elucidate the influence of data on LLMs and subsequently utilize these insights to effectively guide the organization, selection, and synthesis of high-quality data, thereby enhancing the foundational capabilities of LLMs (e.g., instruction following, factuality, and faithfulness).
