  I’m Shuzheng Si, a first-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Tsinghua University. I am lucky to be advised by Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=zIgT0HMAAAAJ">Maosong Sun</a> and affiliated with <a href="https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn">TsinghuaNLP Lab</a>. Previously, I obtained my master’s degree from Peking University, where I was fortunate to be a part of the <a href="https://pkunlp-icler.github.io/">PKU NLP Group</a> under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=LaKNyhQAAAAJ">Baobao Chang</a> at the Institute of Computational Linguistics. My research interests lie in <b>Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs)</b>, specifically focusing on <b>Data-Centric Methods and Data Science for NLP</b>, including:
  <br>
  <ul class="pub">
      <li>
          💡 <b style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Synthesis & Data Selection (Better Understanding of Data)</b>: My first line of research aims to synthesize data more scientifically (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16483">CANOE</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04153">UltraIF</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05282">UltraEdit</a>) and to automatically and effectively evaluate data quality (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07340">NOVA</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15633">GATEAU</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10302">NUGGETS</a>), thereby further advancing the capabilities of LLMs. At the same time, I believe that by designing better data synthesis and data selection methods, we can gain deeper insights into the role of data in LLM training and ultimately make more efficient use of data.
      </li>
      <li>
          🚀 <b style="text-decoration: underline;">Data-Efficient Methods for Post-Training (Better Utilization of Data)</b>: Current LLMs require training on a vast amount of data, which significantly increases the training costs of models. This line of research attempts to utilize data more efficiently, such as leveraging (noisy) data collected from real-world scenarios to train models (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04076">SANTA</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01646">SCL-RAI</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13040">SpokenWOZ</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08010">CENSOR</a>), and maximizing the positive impact of the limited data on models (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07915">MMICL</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08491">ALSACE</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14279">LACING</a>). Ultimately, the goal is to achieve data-efficient artificial intelligence and reach the next level of intelligence (perhaps referred to as AGI) at minimal cost..
      </li>
  </ul>

  My long-term research goal is to elucidate the influence of data on LLMs and subsequently utilize these insights to effectively guide the organization, selection, and synthesis of high-quality data, thereby enhancing the foundational capabilities of LLMs. 
  Recently, I have been very interested in investigating LLMs' hallucinations from a data perspective and attempting to mitigate hallucinations through data-driven approaches.
  <br>
  I'm also interested in working together, so please feel free to email me if there are any opportunities!

  Welcome to my homepage! This photo was taken before I started my research in NLP. Compared to back then, I've gained quite a bit of weight and lost quite a bit of hair :(
