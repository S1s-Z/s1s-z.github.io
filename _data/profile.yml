  Hi, I’m Shuzheng Si, a second-year CS Ph.D. Candidate at Tsinghua University. I am lucky to be advised by Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=zIgT0HMAAAAJ">Maosong Sun</a> and affiliated with <a href="https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn">TsinghuaNLP Lab</a>. Previously, I obtained my master’s degree from Peking University, where I was a part of the <a href="https://pkunlp-icler.github.io/">PKU NLP Group</a> under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=LaKNyhQAAAAJ">Baobao Chang</a>. My research interests lie in <b>Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs)</b>. Recently, my research interests have centred on <b>Hallucinations in LLMs </b>, including:
  <br>
  <ul class="pub">
      <li>
          📖 <b>Hallucination Attribution — Understanding Hallucinations at the Source</b>: My first line of research aims to explore and understand how training data contributes to hallucinations (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07340">NOVA</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15633">GATEAU</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10302">NUGGETS</a>). This line of research mainly focuses on combining both qualitative and quantitative analyses of training data, guiding data collection to reduce LLM hallucinations.
      </li>
      <li>
          🔧 <b>Hallucination Mitigation  — Reducing Hallucinations in LLMs</b>: This line of research focuses on designing effective strategies to reduce hallucinations, covering controllable text generation (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16483">CANOE</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14244">LingoEDU</a>), multi-modal scenarios (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07915">MMICL</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14279">LACING</a>), and agentic tasks (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13040">SpokenWOZ</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05608">EAGLET</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18743">RhinoInsight</a>). These methods provide practical solutions to reduce hallucinations in real-world applications.
      </li>
      <li>
          🔎 <b>Hallucination Detection  — Identifying Hallucinations in the Wild</b>: This research attempts to identify hallucinated responses generated by LLMs and prevent such hallucinated responses from being provided to users (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20182">FaithLens</a>). By enabling the timely hallucination detection and practical interventions, LLM-based systems can be more reliable and trustworthy in real-world deployment.
      </li>
      <li>
          🌏 <b>Building Information-Seeking Tools With the Lowest Hallucination Rates</b>: I also apply my research to build real-world information-seeking applications with the lowest hallucination rates, e.g., <a href="https://lingowhale.com/">LingoWhale</a>, <a href="https://research.deeplang.net/">RhinoInsight</a>, and <a href="https://zhiliao.news/">Zhiliao News</a> released by DeepLang AI and TsinghuaNLP Lab. To date, these applications have provided trustworthy text processing services to hundreds of thousands of Chinese users.
      </li>
  </ul>

  I’m always happy to discuss potential collaborations. Feel free to drop an email if you are interested in connecting. 🕊🕊🕊

  Welcome to my homepage! This photo was taken before I started my research in NLP. Compared to back then, I've gained quite a bit of weight and lost quite a bit of hair :(
