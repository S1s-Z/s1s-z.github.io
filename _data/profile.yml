  I’m Shuzheng Si, a first-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Tsinghua University.  I am lucky to be advised by Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=zIgT0HMAAAAJ">Maosong Sun</a> and affiliated with <a href="https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn">TsinghuaNLP Lab</a>. I obtained my master’s degree from Peking University, where I was fortunate to be a part of the <a href="https://pkunlp-icler.github.io/">PKU NLP Group</a> under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=LaKNyhQAAAAJ">Baobao Chang</a> at the Institute of Computational Linguistics. I spent my sweet undergraduate days at the School of Software (rank: 1/300+), Yunnan University, a beautiful university. </br></br> I actively contribute to the open-source community on <a href="https://github.com/WangRongsheng">🔗GitHub</a> <img alt="GitHub User's stars" src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/wangrongsheng?style=flat-square">, where I’ve led or contributed to several notable projects, including <a href="https://github.com/kaixindelele/ChatPaper/stargazers" target="_blank">ChatPaper <img src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/kaixindelele/ChatPaper?color=orange" alt="GitHub Stars"></a>, <a href="https://github.com/WangRongsheng/XrayGLM/stargazers" target="_blank">XrayGLM <img src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/WangRongsheng/XrayGLM?color=orange" alt="GitHub Stars"></a>, <a href="https://github.com/WangRongsheng/awesome-LLM-resourses/stargazers" target="_blank">Awesome-LLM-Resources <img src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/WangRongsheng/awesome-LLM-resourses?color=orange" alt="GitHub Stars"></a>, and <a href="https://github.com/FreedomIntelligence/TinyDeepSeek/stargazers" target="_blank">TinyDeepSeek <img src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/FreedomIntelligence/TinyDeepSeek?color=orange" alt="GitHub Stars"></a>. I also share datasets and model weights from these projects on <a href="https://huggingface.co/wangrongsheng">🔗HuggingFace</a>, and I enjoy publishing lightweight language models on <a href="https://ollama.com/wangrongsheng">🔗Ollama</a> to support local deployment and usage.
