  Hi, I’m Shuzheng Si, a second-year CS Ph.D. Candidate at Tsinghua University. I am lucky to be advised by Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=zIgT0HMAAAAJ">Maosong Sun</a> and affiliated with <a href="https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn">TsinghuaNLP Lab</a>. Previously, I obtained my master’s degree from Peking University, where I was a part of the <a href="https://pkunlp-icler.github.io/">PKU NLP Group</a> under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=LaKNyhQAAAAJ">Baobao Chang</a>. My research interests lie in <b>Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs)</b>, specifically focusing on <b>Hallucinations in LLMs </b>, including:
  <br>
  <ul class="pub">
      <li>
          📖 <b>Hallucination Attribution — Understanding Hallucinations at the Source</b>: My first line of research aims to understand hallucinations in LLMs from a fundamental perspective: how training data contributes to hallucinations (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07340">NOVA</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15633">GATEAU</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10302">NUGGETS</a>). The main research focus is to combine qualitative and quantitative analyses of training data and develop automated metrics to assess its characteristics, guiding data collection and organization to reduce LLM hallucinations.
      </li>
      <li>
          🚀 <b>Hallucination Mitigation  — Reducing Hallucinations in LLMs</b>: This line of research mainly focuses on exploring different strategies to reduce hallucinations, covering text generation (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16483">CANOE</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14244">LingoEDU</a>), multi-modal scenarios(<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07915">MMICL</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14279">LACING</a>), and agentic tasks (<a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05608">EAGLET</a>, <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18743">RhinoInsight</a>). Together, these methods provide practical and efficient solutions for reducing hallucinations in real-world applications.
      </li>
      <li>
          🔎 <b>Hallucination Detection  — Managing Hallucinations in Practice</b>: This line of research focuses on hallucination detection as a core capability for making LLM outputs reliable and usable in real-world applications (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20182">FaithLens</a>. By enabling timely identification of hallucinations during generation, this research lays the foundation for practical interventions such as on-the-fly correction, uncertainty signaling, and human-in-the-loop verification, making LLM-based systems more reliable and controllable in real-world deployment.
      </li>
      <li>
          🌏 <b>Building Information-Seeking Tools With the Lowest Hallucination Rates</b>: I also apply my research to build real-world information-seeking applications, e.g., <a href="https://lingowhale.com/">LingoWhale</a>, <a href="https://research.deeplang.net/">RhinoInsight</a>, and <a href="https://zhiliao.news/">Zhiliao News</a> released by DeepLang AI and TsinghuaNLP Lab. To date, these applications have provided intelligent text information processing services to hundreds of thousands of Chinese users.
      </li>
  </ul>

  My research goal is to elucidate the influence of data on LLMs and utilize these insights to guide the construction of data, thereby building the LLM-based language processing engine. <b>Recently, I have been interested in investigating LLMs' hallucinations from a data perspective and exploring data-driven hallucination mitigation methods for information-seeking tools.</b> 🕊🕊🕊

  Welcome to my homepage! This photo was taken before I started my research in NLP. Compared to back then, I've gained quite a bit of weight and lost quite a bit of hair :(
