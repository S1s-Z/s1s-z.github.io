  Hi, I’m Shuzheng Si, a second-year CS Ph.D. Candidate at Tsinghua University. I am lucky to be advised by Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=zIgT0HMAAAAJ">Maosong Sun</a> from the <a href="https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn">TsinghuaNLP Lab</a>. Before this, I obtained my master’s degree from Peking University, where I was supervised by Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=LaKNyhQAAAAJ">Baobao Chang</a> at the Institute of Computational Linguistics. My research interests lie in <b>Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models</b>. Recently, I have been interested in a fundamental challenge for LLMs: <b> Hallucinations</b>.

  I’m always happy to discuss potential collaborations. Feel free to drop an email if you are interested in connecting. 🕊🕊🕊

  Welcome to my homepage! This photo was taken before I started my research in NLP. Compared to back then, I've gained quite a bit of weight and lost quite a bit of hair :(
